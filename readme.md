# Betaburlogin
Firefox addon to allow automation in [Avabur's beta server](https://beta.avabur.com)

#### Features:
* Login with all your alts at once.
* Move alts together between mobs.
* Send currency between alts.
* Automatic stamina.
* Automatic quests.
* Automatic construction.
* Automatic harvestron.
* Automatic crafting.
* Automatic events.
* Remove the "effects info" box.

##### Plans:
* Add custom CSS style.
* Currently, most of the automation features are toggable. Allow on/off toggling for all features.
* Make keepUsernameVisible actually work


###### Notes:
1. This addon Requires Container Tabs.
2. For now, you will probably have to edit the code to be able to use it for your alts. No documentation is available, sorry.
3. Editing the code to run this addon on the live server will get you banned.
